A custom made user friendly checkweight system that allows the operator to scan an item from a barcode, search the item in the database, and as a result give information of the expected target weight for that item. The checkweight system proceeds to display a YELLOW scale for UNDER, RED scale for OVER, and GREEN scale for ACCEPTED.

Lastly it allows the operator to print a summary of the bags with available options for Godex Formatted Printers or Honeywell Datamax Printers.
